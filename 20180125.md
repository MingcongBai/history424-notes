World War I - From Crisis to War
--------------------------------

- June 28th, 1914 - assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife by
  a Boznian student linked to the Nationalist movement.
    - Franz Ferdinand was a heir of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, possible link
      to ethnic conflicts?
- Tsar (Czar) Nicholas II was not overly alarmed by the incident, and went on
  a vacation shortly afterwards. Tsar returned from his vacation later to meet
  the French President Raymond Poincaré to reassure the Franco-Russian Alliance.
    - The Triple Enténte - France, Russia, and Britain.
- An Ultimatum was sent to the Serbian government by the Austro-Hungarian
  Empire, instructing censorship in publications of contents harming or
  attacking the Empire, and to allow police operation directly from the Empire
  to record and send names of dissidents against the Empire.
    - Was this a reasonable demand? If so, why? (Geopolitical implications)
    - Was this an unreasonable demand? (Exploitation and expansion of power,
      imperialism, ...)

Sergei Sazonov, "This means European war!"
------------------------------------------

- Foreign Minister of the Tsarist Russia from November 1910, to July 1916.
- Put forth diplomatic efforts to ease tension between the two parties:
  instructing Serbia to comply with the demands, while pleading for the
  Austro-Hungarian Empire to back down.

The Tripple Alliance, Secret Opponent of the Enténte
----------------------------------------------------

- German Empire, Kingdom of Italy, and Austro-Hungarian Empire.
- Kaiser Wilhelm II offered unconditional support to Austro-Hungarian Empire
  in case of a war.

Serbian Response
----------------

- Although Serbia declared the demands unreasonable, accepted some of the
  demands. The demands regarding the censorship of public opinion was rejected.


Russian Empire in World War I - A Timeline in Brief
---------------------------------------------------

- July 24th, 1914. Partial mobilisation in districts close to the borders of
  Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Imperial court declared the move diplomatic.
- July 25th, 1914. Discussions were made regarding the enlarging scale of
  mobilisation against the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
- July 28th, 1914. Austro-Hungarian Empire declared war against Serbia.
- July 30th, 1914. Tsar Nicholas II declared complete mobilisation against
  the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and officially declared war one day later.

- The Tsar changed his mind soon after, however, as he received a threatening
  telegraph from Kaiser Wilhelm II. His ministers were able to convince him
  to hang on to the war effort.
    - However, at this point, it is valuable to consider the possible reasons
      for Russia's involvement in the war against the Austro-Hungarian Empire
      without a direct territorial conflict. Pan-Slavism? Chauvinism?
- The German Empire, referring to the pre-existing Triple Alliance, delcared
  war against the Russian Empire (member of the Triple Enténte).
