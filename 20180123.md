Introduction, "Tours to the Soviet Union"
-----------------------------------------

- Professor: Francine Hirsch, author of "Empire of Nations".
- Class components...
    - The survey of the components of the Soviet Union (or the Union of
      Soviet Socialist Republics, if you prefer): Russia, and the often

Examples of Said "Interactions"
-------------------------------

- The United States played a major role in the construction of the Soviet Union
  in its early ages... The sponsorship in technologies and funding from
  American enterprises (Ford), which contributed to the consolidation and
  industrialisation of the Soviet Union in the 1920s.
- Multi-front technological, military, and cultural exchanges on the
  international stage before and during the Cold War period (classical
  definition used here, 1946-1990 or 1991).
    - Weimar Republic collaborated with the Soviet Union in the
      researches and development of chemical weapons in the Interwar Period,
      to work around international ban of military development in the Weimar
      Republic.
    - Significant loans to the People's Republic of China in the early 1950s,
      experts sent to aid in its development, and collaborated programme in
      China's own nuclear weapons.
    - Break-up with China as Khrushchev came to power in the mid-1950s which
      split the "Team Communist", birth to non-Soviet-aligned Communist
      movements and states.
